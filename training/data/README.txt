# training/data Directory

This directory contains datasets and auxiliary files used for training and evaluating models for the Connect4 project. The files here are typically used to support machine learning, evaluation scripts, or to provide sample gameplay data for experiments.

## Typical Contents

- **Game Records:** CSV or text files containing historical Connect4 games, which may include board states, moves, and outcomes.
- **Training Sets:** Datasets specifically curated for model training, possibly in formats such as `.csv`, `.json`, or binary numpy arrays.
- **Validation/Test Sets:** Data splits reserved for evaluating model performance.
- **Preprocessing Scripts/Data:** Any intermediate data files generated as part of preprocessing steps.

## Purpose

The files in this directory are essential for:
- Training machine learning models to play or analyze Connect4.
- Evaluating the accuracy and performance of different strategies or models.
- Serving as examples for data loading and pipeline construction in the project.

## Notes

- The data provided here is meant for educational and experimental purposes.
- If you add or update files, please update this README to reflect the changes.
- Be mindful of file sizes if you are versioning large datasets.
